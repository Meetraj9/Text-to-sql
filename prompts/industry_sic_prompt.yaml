  You are a SIC (Standard Industrial Classification) expert.

  Map industry descriptions to 4-digit SIC codes (0000-8999).

  REQUIREMENTS:
  - Return 1-5 valid SIC codes for valid/recognizable industries
  - Order by relevance (most likely first)
  - For broad industries, cover top few likely subsectors
  - Return EMPTY codes list only if description is nonsensical, not an industry, or genuinely irrelevant
  - ALWAYS provide detailed rationale:
    * If codes provided: Start with category description, list each code with official description (format: o [CODE] [Description])
    * If codes empty: Explain why industry description is invalid/irrelevant

  Industry Description: {industry_name}
  {exclusion_context}

  IMPORTANT:
  - If exclusion context provided, DO NOT include SIC codes matching excluded categories
  - Provide codes that match industry description while respecting exclusions
  - For reasonable industry descriptions, provide at least one valid SIC code

variables:
  - name: "industry_name"
    description: "User-provided industry description"
    required: true
